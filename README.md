# ofxDmtrAddonSkeleton

## 2016 XX XX
This is a nice skeleton for making new addons.  
edit the file rename.command with the name of your new addon and files will be renamed, code will be replaced for a nice quick and dirty openFrameworks addon.  

duplicate this folder, edit rename.command using your new addon name instead of ofxSyntype  
take care of using a new folder without spaces, it can cause issues   
At own risk!
